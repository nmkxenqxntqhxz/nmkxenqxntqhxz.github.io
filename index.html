		Hello Ms. Riya Agarwal! 
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, I set aside my ego and write this. Riya, I have committed a lot of mistakes in the past. You have also committed a few mistakes. Can we both realize our mistakes and forgive each other? I know it won't be easy for any of us to do so, but can we try? <br><br>
		Riya, I am in dire need of a friend with whom I can share my thoughts, whom I can ask for advice, whom I can trust! And let me tell you, it's you and only you who can fulfill this need! Once you told me, why do you want to be with me? Why don't you try on someone else? Taking inspiration from this, I literally tried to talk to every approachable girl! (please don't make a judgement!) Yes, there was a time when I used to be immature enough and was quite afraid to talk to girls, but now, it's not like that. I didn't find even a single one trustworthy. Or maybe I can't trust any other person!!
		<br>
		<br>
		Riya, see there are three kinds of people in our life. One, for whom we don't care what they do (acquaintances), two, our friends (the so-called ones or not very close ones), and three, the people whom we can count upon completely (the mirror). Yes, there are very few around me whom I can trust till some extent, but there is always a feeling of doubt lying within. The emotions that I feel while talking to you are found nowhere else. See, we both share a bond. And this special bond, I don't find it even with a single person (except you) and I don't think I would ever find it. <br><br>
		Will you be my mirror? 
		<br><br>
		Yes, this is the question for which I want the answer in yes/no. It's not like my life isn't functional without you, no, I won't let this happen. You remember you said to me "fuck off", I tried to do the same. I said so to you (in my mind), and placed a The End. But, the sad part is things do not end. I have tried doing so, I have tried looking for other girls, and some other stuff as well. I just can't. The bond, the level of trust, I just can't develop that with anybody else. I tried my best, but I couldn't. The case is like, either you or none!<br><br>

		See, there are four options (the first being my choice, and the second yours) : <br>
		
		
		1. No and No<br>
		2. No and Yes<br>
		3. Yes and No<br>
		4. Yes and Yes<br>

		<br>
		The first three options lead to "the fuck off" state, and the fourth one leads to the "mirror" state. Make your choice.
		<br><br>
		Initially I thought to meet you and say to you all this, but you would have never agreed to this! Then I thought of messaging you, but found myself blocked. I also blocked you but then I thought to not make any decision only by my own intuition. That's why I figured out this way!<br><br>
		Though I thought, it won't take much time, but it took longer than expected! Anyway, I wasn't expecting a chat on hike. Just a minute, you look really beautiful in that pic. And yes, I know your response which you chose to not do on that chat. :P <br><br>
		And haan, read the address of this website again ;)<br><br>
		All the Best for your exam!
